        <h2>First Day as a Second year Computer Science Major</h2>
        <p class="post-meta">September 31, 2024</p>

        <p>Hey everyone, this first blog serves to give you all a quick over view of how my first day of school was as a second year Computer Science Major.</p>
        <p>For most students, second year is a very crucial year for all students of all majors. It is when the work load becomes 10 times more intense and when our GPA begins to matter. On the first day, i was already beginning to feel the pressure, by the end of the day, we already had assignments and test due the following week. Someone please help!!!.</p>
